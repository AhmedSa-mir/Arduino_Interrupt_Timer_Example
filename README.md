# Arduino example code for interrupts and timers
A simple arduino program which makes use of digital IO pins interrupts and timer interrupts.
## Prerequisites and assumptions
+ Arduino Uno board working on **5V**
+ Push button
+ LM35 temperature sensor
+ Arduino IDE working on any OS
## Getting the example up and running
+ Connect the push button on digital Pin 2 in the arduino board
+ Connect the LM35 temperature sensor on analog Pin 0 in the arduino board
+ Download the code file example.ino 
+ Create a new project in arduino IDE and import the example.ino file
+ Verify and upload the code to the arduino board

**P.S: You can change the input connection pins from the code**
