## Application build process
First I divided the app into two main components: the switch and LED component and the temperature sensor component.

I started with the first component: the switch and the LED. I implemented the functionality and tested it on my Arduino board. It was straight forward. Then I wrote more comments to make the code clear.

Then I jumped into the second component. I figured out that I will need a timer. I searched the internet to recover my knowledge about the different timer modes in arduino. Then I built a function for configuring the timer. After that I implemented the timer and the sensor code. 

Finally, I merged the two codes together and I tested the final code. Then I wrote the README.md files.

## What I've learnt
 I didn't acquire new knowledge as I had good experience building apps with arduino. But I refreshed my mind with the timer and interrupt concepts. I searched the internet to see different implementations of the two components of the application and then built the application.
